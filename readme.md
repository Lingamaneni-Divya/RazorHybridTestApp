1. Understanding the Requirement:

Given NFR 1.1, when I review its details, I should be able to identify its purpose, scope, and constraints.



2. Applicability Assessment:

When I analyze NFR 1.1, I should be able to determine whether it applies to our application based on architecture, technology stack, and business needs.

If applicable, I should list the impacted components, dependencies, and areas requiring changes.

If not applicable, I should provide a justification for exclusion.



3. Impact Analysis:

When reviewing the requirement, I should assess its impact on performance, security, scalability, maintainability, and compliance with industry standards.

I should document risks and potential challenges in implementation.



4. Action Plan Creation:

If NFR 1.1 is applicable, I should outline an action plan that includes implementation steps, timeline, and responsibilities.

The plan should include testing strategies, performance benchmarks, and monitoring mechanisms.

If any changes are required in architecture or code, I should document high-level recommendations.



5. Stakeholder Review:

The analysis report and action plan should be shared with relevant stakeholders (architects, testers, product owners) for review and approval.

Any feedback from stakeholders should be addressed, and necessary modifications should be incorporated into the plan.
